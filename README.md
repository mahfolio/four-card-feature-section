## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've learned a lot. I've learned how to start a project, and progress step by step. I've tried to use what I learned so far on both html and css. It was a challenge for me to think about the problem, and find out a solution. I've tried to implement the whole projection on my own, but I got some ideas from Kevin Powell, though. I've tried not to follow him entirely, I wanted to implement the layout especially on my own. Eventually, I've implemented the project as close as I can, but I feel my CSS rules are messy!

### Continued development

I want to hone my skill on layout especially using grid. And also would like to further imrove the layout for the desktop version of this project.
